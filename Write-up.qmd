### Research Question:
* How do rising interest rates disproportionately affect African countries, and what policy measures can mitigate these challenges?
* This study examines the factors contributing to the high debt-servicing burdens faced by African nations and evaluates potential policy solutions, such as interest rate reductions and debt restructuring, to address these challenges.

### Data Sources:
* World Bank Databank (World Development Indicators): Data on debt-to-GNI ratios, interest payments.
* Credit Rating Data: Average credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies (Standard & Poor's, Moody's, Fitch). These ratings were quantified and obtained through internal access at the United Nations Development Programme's Regional Bureau for Africa.
* International Debt Statistics (World Bank): Supplementary data on external debt levels and repayment trends.

### Approach and codings

### Findings
1. Static Plot

* Debt Landscape (2012-2022)

Annual borrowing in Africa (~$80 billion) is largely offset by repayments, limiting net financing for development.

* Interest Payments on External Debt (2022):



Countries such as Somalia, Mozambique, Angola, and Zambia experience the heaviest burdens (>5% of GNI), driven by factors including political instability and reliance on commodity exports.

North African nations, benefiting from oil wealth, generally have lower burdens, highlighting disparities within the continent.

2. Dynamic Analysis (Shiny App)

* Weighted Average Interest Rates

African countries face a significantly higher average (1.95%) compared to non-African emerging markets (1.55%).

* Credit Rating Comparison: 

Within the same credit ratings, African countries consistently pay higher interest rates. For instance, BB-rated African countries face rates near 3%, compared to just over 1% for non-African peers.

### Policy Recommendations
* Debt Restructuring and Rate Reductions: Alleviate financial burdens and allow reallocation of funds toward infrastructure and economic development.
* Targeted Support: International institutions should prioritize Sub-Saharan Africa in their debt relief initiatives, considering the regionâ€™s unique challenges.

### Challenges
* Data Availability: Inconsistent macro economic data across African countries.
* Analytical Complexity: Difficulty in isolating the effects of external factors, such as commodity price fluctuations and geopolitical issues.

### Future Research
* Investigate the relationship between governance indicators and debt-servicing outcomes.
* Conduct case studies on successful debt restructuring in Africa.
* Expand the analysis to include other regions, such as Latin America or Southeast Asia, for comparative insights.
